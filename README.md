Retro VuFind
============

Introduction
------------
We as an open-source community are always striving to provide the most modern and user-friendly experience a library discovery layer can offer. Here at the VuFind Offices, we lounged around on our money and talked about the future design of VuFind. We reached far ahead to design a new theme for VuFind that will be modern, fast and gorgeous. We reached to far ahead: into the past.

*Introducing the new default VuFind theme: telestrap*

Combining modern web speeds with the low bandwidth technology of Teletext&tm;, we've created the most forward looking theme imaginable. Enjoy.
